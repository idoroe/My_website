      <h2>About {PERSON_NAME}</h2>
      <p>
        4th-year Software Engineering student at the University of Calgary's Schulich School of Engineering
        (graduating June 2028) with hands-on experience in data engineering, full-stack development, AI model training,
        and production infrastructure. Incoming Data Engineering Intern at RBC Borealis on the Enterprise Data Hub team (May 2026).
      </p>

      <h3>Key Projects</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>FinSight</strong> — End-to-end anomaly-detection pipeline that ingests 50K synthetic banking transactions, transforms them through a dbt dimensional model (staging → intermediate → marts), and scores them with an Isolation Forest via FastAPI. DuckDB star schema (fact + 3 dimension tables) with dbt-managed transformations and data quality tests. Containerized Docker Compose stack with single-command startup.</li>
        <li><strong>PipelineX</strong> — 4-stage CI/CD pipeline (lint → tests → build → Trivy scan) that blocks merges on quality or security failures. Production Docker Compose deployment with health checks across 4 services. Prometheus (15+ metrics) and Grafana dashboards for latency, error rates, and restarts, enabling sub-5-minute incident diagnosis.</li>
        <li><strong>LabelForge</strong> — Full-stack annotation platform with React, TypeScript, Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, and JWT Auth. 3 role-based workflows (Annotator, Reviewer, Admin) with a task state machine enforcing valid transitions at the API level. Keyboard shortcuts enhancing usability for 15+ reviewers, reducing revision requests by 30%. Quality dashboard with per-annotator metrics filterable by project.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Key Qualifications</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Programming languages: Python, Java, SQL, C, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#</li>
        <li>Frameworks & Libraries: React, Django, FastAPI, Flask, REST APIs, scikit-learn</li>
        <li>Tools & Technologies: AWS, Docker, Docker Compose, dbt, DuckDB, Git, GitHub Actions, Prometheus, Grafana, Trivy, WebSockets</li>
        <li>Performance engineering: cut page loads by 44%, reduced p95 query times by 67% at Learn Easy Academy</li>
        <li>AI model training: write 50 Java/OOP prompts weekly at Mindrift AI, improving eval accuracy ~20%; created JS/React training sets at Outlier AI raising accuracy by 20%</li>
        <li>Strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, OOP (Java), and software design (C++)</li>
      </ul>
