## The Story

Most portfolio projects end at "it works on my laptop." PipelineX is everything that comes after — the production infrastructure that makes FinSight reliable, observable, and automatically recoverable.

It wraps the FinSight API in a full CI/CD pipeline (lint, test, build, security scan), adds Prometheus metrics collection, and surfaces everything through a Grafana dashboard. Docker health checks and restart policies mean the system self-heals when containers crash.

The demo says it all: I kill the API container, the dashboard spikes red, and 10 seconds later it's green again — automatically.

## CI/CD Pipeline

Every push to main triggers a 4-stage GitHub Actions workflow:

1. **Lint** — ruff checks Python code quality
2. **Test** — pytest runs API unit tests
3. **Build** — Docker images built for API and frontend
4. **Security Scan** — Trivy scans container images for CRITICAL/HIGH vulnerabilities

The pipeline visualization in GitHub is itself a portfolio piece — it shows a clear, professional workflow that mirrors what real engineering teams use.

## Observability Stack

The FinSight API exposes a `/metrics` endpoint using `prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator`. Prometheus scrapes these metrics every 15 seconds. Grafana reads from Prometheus and displays 5 dashboard panels:

1. **Request Rate** — traffic patterns over time
2. **Error Rate** — spikes red when 5xx errors increase
3. **P95 Latency** — 95th percentile response time
4. **Container Status** — green (up) or red (down)
5. **Request Duration Heatmap** — visual density of response times

The Grafana dashboard is auto-provisioned — it loads on boot with no manual configuration.

## Self-Healing

Docker health checks ping `/health` every 10 seconds. Combined with `restart: always` in Docker Compose, crashed containers are automatically restarted within seconds. No human intervention needed.

## Failure Recovery Demo

A shell script simulates a production incident:

1. Generates normal traffic (20 API requests)
2. Kills the API container (`docker kill`)
3. Monitors recovery attempts every 2 seconds
4. Reports when the API is healthy again (~10–15 seconds)

The Grafana dashboard captures the full story: traffic flowing, sudden drop, error spike, recovery, metrics stabilizing. This 15-second clip is the most compelling visual in my entire portfolio.

## What I'd Add Next

- Terraform for cloud provisioning (AWS ECS)
- Kubernetes deployment manifests
- ELK stack for centralized logging
- Alerting rules with Grafana notifications (Slack/email)
- Chaos engineering with more failure scenarios
